    Tweeted on March 21, 2006 by @Jack this was the start of a social media giant. 
    Fun and addicting, this quick and easy micro-blogging platform has been around
    for over ten years now and has become a staple in many people's lives. It is used 
    for fun, politics, marketing, business, social connections, and more by over 300 million people now.

    Named after the Oxford dictionary definition of twitter, this social media platform was created by Jack 
    Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. This new form of media had a slow start as no one knew 
    exactly what to call it - microblogging, social media? - until the annual South by Southwest Interactive 
    conference of 2007 where the amount of tweets per day tripled. Here it also received highly positive reviews. 
    This is the same year that the hashtag is first proposed by user Chris Messina. In one year, from 2007 to 
    2008 the amount of tweets per quarter skyrocketed from 400,000 to 100 million. And another year later it 
    climbed from being the 22nd ranked social networking site on Compete.com to the third. That same year, 2009, 
    the death of Michael Jackson crashed servers, proving how much more people tweet during big world or pop culture 
    events. Also the news of the Hudson River US Airways crash was first broke on Twitter, setting the trend for breaking 
    news to regularly be broke on social media before traditional outlets.

    The next year promoted tweets, trends, and accounts were debuted. In 2011, the site was overhauled to increase the usability
    and appearance as it reached 1 billion tweets sent per week and in 2012 the logo was changed to showcase the 
    solo bird we all know today. It was then that even the president started tweeting and became the most retweeted with this 
    tweet. Two years later Ellen DeGeneres blows that tweet out of the water with her Oscars selfie, which has now been retweeted over 3.3 million times.

    In 2015 the desktop homepage was changed again. This year Twitter teamed with google so users of the search engine now see relevant tweets towards 
    the top of their results. And to many users' dismay the favorite stars are changed to like hearts.

    And that brings to today and the current twitter we all know. What the future will hold for this decade old site no one knows, but one thing is for
    sure it is still a platform full of opportunities, especially for the modern digital writer.
